### Stage 3: Game Modes and Additional Features
1. **Difficulty Levels Implementation**
   - Easy (slow falling)
   - Medium (standard falling)
   - Hard (fast falling)

2. **Game Modes Implementation**
   - Classic (until end of game)
   - Timed (maximizing points in a specified time)
   - Challenge (clearing a specified number of rows)

3. **Save/Load System Implementation**
   - Saving game state to database
   - Loading saved state

4. **Statistics System Implementation**
   - Collecting gameplay data
