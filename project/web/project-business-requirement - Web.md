I wanted to create a 2D Tetris game. Description:
"Tetris is a game where you arrange falling blocks (tetrominoes) to fill rows on a board. The goal is to clear full rows, which scores points and prevents the board from overflowing. The game ends when no new block can be placed on the board."

I've already implemented this as a desktop application in .Net 9. Now I'd like to add a web application based on SignalR.
