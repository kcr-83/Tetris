# Tetris Web Application - Feature Requirements

## Project Overview

This document outlines the feature requirements for a three-tier web application prototype of Tetris using SignalR for real-time communication. The application builds upon the existing console implementation in the `Tetris.Core` library and extends it to a web-based platform.

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: .NET 9.0, C#, SignalR
- Frontend: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Storage: Entity Framework Core, SQL Server/SQLite

## Work Already Completed (Console Implementation)

The following components are already implemented in the `Tetris.Core` project:

### Core Game Logic ✅
- **Board.cs**: 10x20 game board with collision detection and row clearing
- **Tetromino Hierarchy**: All 7 standard pieces (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) with rotation logic
- **GameEngine.cs**: Complete game mechanics, scoring, levels, and timing
- **TetrominoController.cs**: Unified input handling and piece movement
- **TetrominoFactory.cs**: Piece generation and randomization

### Game Features ✅
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard with speed progression
- **Game Modes**: Classic, Timed, Challenge
- **Scoring System**: Standard Tetris scoring with line clear bonuses
- **Statistics Tracking**: GameStatistics.cs with comprehensive metrics
- **Save/Load System**: UserSettings.cs and game state persistence

### UI Components ✅
- **Console Interface**: Responsive console-based gameplay
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard controls with soft/hard drop
- **Display Components**: Game board, next piece preview, statistics

## Definition of Done

For each user story to be considered complete:
1. **Functional**: Feature works as described in the user story
2. **Tested**: Unit tests for backend logic, integration tests for SignalR
3. **Performance**: Meets 60fps requirement for gameplay
4. **Responsive**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
5. **Accessible**: Meets basic WCAG 2.1 guidelines
6. **Compatible**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
7. **Documented**: Code is documented and user-facing features have help text

## Prioritization

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: EP01, EP02, F03-01, F04-01 - Basic playable web version
**Phase 2 (Enhanced)**: EP03, EP04, F05-01, F05-02 - Full feature parity with console
**Phase 3 (Advanced)**: EP05, EP06, EP07 - Web-specific enhancements and optimization

This approach leverages the robust game logic already implemented in the console version while adding the web-specific features needed for a modern, real-time multiplayer-ready Tetris experience.
