# Save/Load System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Tetris game now has a complete save/load system that allows players to save their current game state and resume later. The system includes:

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Models
- **GameState.cs**: Serializable class containing all game state data
- **GameLoadedEventArgs.cs**: Event arguments for loaded game events
- **TetrominoState.cs**: Serializable tetromino representation
- **SaveMetadata.cs**: Metadata for save files (timestamps, version, etc.)

### 2. Service Layer
- **GameSaveService.cs**: Complete service for saving/loading games to/from JSON files
  - Quick save functionality
  - Named save slots
  - Save file management
  - Error handling and validation

### 3. User Interface
- **SaveGameDialog.cs**: Interactive dialog for entering save names
- **LoadGameDialog.cs**: Interactive dialog for selecting saves to load
- Updated **MainMenuInterface.cs**: Integrated load game functionality
- Updated **GameplayInterface.cs**: Added save command to help text and pause menu
- Updated **TetrisGame.cs**: Added save during gameplay and game loading

### 4. Game Engine Integration
- **GameEngine.cs**: Added `CreateGameState()` and `LoadGameState()` methods
- **Board.cs**: Added `LoadState()` method for restoring board state
- **TetrominoFactory.cs**: Added `CreateFromState()` and `CreateById()` methods

## Features

### Save Functionality
- **During Gameplay**: Press 'S' to save the current game
- **When Paused**: Press 'S' to access save dialog
- **Quick Save**: Automatic save slot for rapid saves
- **Named Saves**: Custom save names for multiple save slots

### Load Functionality
- **Main Menu**: "Load Game" option shows available saves
- **Save Selection**: Interactive dialog with save details
- **Metadata Display**: Shows save time, level, score, and mode

### Data Persistence
- **JSON Format**: Human-readable save files
- **Complete State**: Saves board, current piece, next piece, score, level, etc.
- **Metadata**: Version info, timestamps, and game statistics
- **Save Directory**: Organized in "Saves" folder

## User Controls
- **S**: Save game (during gameplay or when paused)
- **P**: Pause/unpause game
- **ESC**: Return to menu
- **Load Game**: Available from main menu

## File Structure
```
Saves/
├── quicksave.tetris          # Quick save slot
├── my_game.tetris           # Named save example
└── final_boss.tetris        # Another named save
```

## Error Handling
- Invalid save names validation
- File system error handling
- Corrupted save file detection
- User-friendly error messages

## Integration Points
1. **Main Menu**: Load game integration with GameLoaded event
2. **Gameplay**: Save functionality accessible via hotkey
3. **Pause Menu**: Enhanced with save option
4. **Game Engine**: State export/import methods

## Technical Details
- **Async Operations**: All save/load operations are asynchronous
- **Event-Driven**: Uses events for loose coupling between components
- **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns between UI, services, and models
- **Exception Safety**: Comprehensive error handling throughout

## Future Enhancements
- Auto-save functionality
- Save file compression
- Save file encryption
- Cloud save integration
- Save slot management UI

The save/load system is now fully functional and integrated into the game!
